<h1 align="center">Ara単a: Discovering and Characterizing Password Guessing Attacks in Practice</h1>

Ara単a is a tool for identifying  attack campaigns from login logs. We detail the pipeline of this tool in our USENIX Seuciryt 2023 paper [Ara単a: Discovering and Characterizing Password Guessing Attacks in Practice](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/islam). This repository contains a proof of concept implementation of Ara単a on the login logs collected via our prior work [Gossamer (USENIX Security 2022)](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/sanusi-bohuk).
